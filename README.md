# Cardlay Frontend challenge
By Luka Djordjevic

Created with React.js and Ant Design for UI framework. You can update table values by selecting appropriate cell, entering new value and pressing `Enter`. Only numbers with optional decimal values are allowed for `amount` column. All updated values persist in localStorage, as does table pagination and sorting preference.

## Installation

Clone repo and then<br>
`yarn install`<br>
`yarn start`

Run tests with<br>
`yarn test`

## Final notes
If I had more time, I would have brought the component more in line with the provided design (i.e. merchant field editing), and consulted more on the design specifics (i.e. whether input boxes should appear on mouse hover or should they be present all the time and similar UX considerations). Also I would write more comprehensive end-to-end tests and convert the component to TypeScript.

Any comments would be appreciated.
